We're excited to announce the launch of our new specialized website for Mayonic Medical Weight Management Center! Our redesigned site reflects our dedication to providing comprehensive, evidence-based care for individuals seeking support with weight management and obesity treatment.

## Our Specialized Approach

Our weight management center takes a multidisciplinary approach that includes:

- **Medical Assessment and Treatment**: Comprehensive evaluations and evidence-based medical interventions supervised by board-certified obesity medicine specialists

## Understanding Obesity as a Medical Condition

At Mayonic Medical, we recognize that obesity is a complex, chronic medical condition influenced by genetic, environmental, and psychological factorsâ€”not simply a matter of willpower or lifestyle choices. Our approach treats obesity as the multifaceted health condition it is, with the same medical rigor applied to any other chronic disease.

Dr. Sarah Mayonic, our founder and medical director, explains: "Many patients come to us after years of struggling with weight cycling and feeling blamed for their condition. We provide a judgment-free environment where patients receive evidence-based treatments and the comprehensive support needed for sustainable results."

## What Sets Us Apart

Our center distinguishes itself through:

- **Medical Expertise**: Our team includes board-certified obesity medicine specialists trained in the latest treatment approaches
- **Individualized Care**: We recognize that everyone's weight management journey is unique and requires personalized solutions
- **Whole-Person Approach**: Addressing the physical, emotional, and environmental factors affecting weight
- **Supportive Environment**: Creating a judgment-free space where patients are treated with dignity and respect
- **Evidence-Based Methods**: Utilizing treatments supported by scientific research and clinical evidence

## Join Us on the Journey

Whether you're concerned about weight-related health conditions, have struggled with weight management for years, or are just beginning to explore treatment options, we're here to support you.

  # Basic Mifflin-St Jeor Equation for BMR
  if gender.downcase == "female"
    bmr = (10 * weight_kg) + (6.25 * height_cm) - (5 * age) - 161
  else
    bmr = (10 * weight_kg) + (6.25 * height_cm) - (5 * age) + 5
  end
  
  puts "Your estimated Basal Metabolic Rate is #{bmr.round} calories per day"
end

# Example usage
calculate_metabolic_rate(70, 170, 40, "female")
#=> prints 'Your estimated Basal Metabolic Rate is 1359 calories per day' to the console.
